# Docker Build Issue Resolution

## Problems
1. **Docker build failing**: Exit code 127 when trying to install DFX
2. **Vessel installation failing**: `wget: not found` error
3. **Container restarting**: `tail: command not found` error

### Original Error:
```
failed to solve: process "/bin/sh -c curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh | bash" did not complete successfully: exit code 127
```

### Additional Errors:
```
wget: not found
tail: command not found
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. Using Alpine Linux as the base image, which uses musl libc instead of glibc
2. Manually installing DFX via the installation script, which had compatibility issues with Alpine
3. Missing dependencies or environmental setup required for the DFX installation script

## Solution
Switched to using the **official ICP development environment** as the base Docker image:

### Before (Problematic)
```dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.19 AS builder
# ... manual DFX installation
RUN curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh | bash
```

### After (Fixed)
```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/dfinity/icp-dev-env:latest
# DFX, Node.js, Rust, and all tools are pre-installed and working
# Install Vessel using curl (not wget, which isn't available)
RUN curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/vessel https://github.com/dfinity/vessel/releases/latest/download/vessel-linux64 \
    && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/vessel
```

## Benefits of the New Approach

1. **Reliability**: Uses DFINITY's officially maintained environment
2. **Completeness**: Includes DFX, Node.js, Rust, PocketIC, and all necessary tools
3. **Compatibility**: Guaranteed to work with the latest IC ecosystem
4. **Maintenance**: Updates automatically with new releases from DFINITY
5. **Simplicity**: Much cleaner Dockerfile (from ~60 lines to ~20 lines)

## What's Included in the Official Image

- **DFX**: Internet Computer development framework
- **Node.js**: For frontend development 
- **Rust**: For Rust canisters (though we're using Motoko)
- **PocketIC**: Local testing environment
- **Vessel**: Motoko package manager (we add this)
- **All dependencies**: Pre-configured and tested environment

## Testing the Fix

To test the fix:

1. **Rebuild the container:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Verify DFX works:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec dfx bash
   dfx --version
   ```

3. **Run the test workflow:**
   ```bash
   scripts/start-replica.bat
   scripts/deploy-pocketflow.bat
   ```

## Files Updated

- **Dockerfile**: Complete rewrite using official ICP dev environment
- **TROUBLESHOOTING.md**: Added section about this Docker build issue
- **README.md**: Updated to mention the official ICP dev environment
- **DOCKER_FIX_SUMMARY.md**: This documentation file

## Reference

- Official ICP Dev Environment: https://github.com/dfinity/icp-dev-env
- Docker Hub: `ghcr.io/dfinity/icp-dev-env:latest`
- Example projects using this environment: Listed in the ICP dev env README

This fix ensures reliable, repeatable builds for all developers working with PocketFlow Motoko.
